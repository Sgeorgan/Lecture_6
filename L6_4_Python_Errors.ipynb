    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook designed for beginner Python programmers. Understanding and resolving errors is a crucial part of programming. Errors are not your enemies; they are helpful messages that guide you to find and fix issues in your code. In this notebook, we'll explore common types of errors you'll encounter while coding in Python and learn how to address them."
