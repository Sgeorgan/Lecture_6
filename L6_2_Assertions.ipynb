For us, this means that we should take steps to handle unexpected input values in our code, and to provide helpful error messages that provide meaningful guidance to the user when a program raises an exception. We can take steps toward writing more reliable software by utilizing a helpful features in Python: Assertions.\n",

Let's start by considering the function `convert_kph_ms` that converts wind speeds from kilometers per hour to meters per second. We can define and use our function in the cell below."

    "Assertions serve as a powerful tool for developers to ensure their code behaves as expected during runtime. By explicitly checking conditions that must be true for the code to function correctly, assertions help identify bugs early in the development process. The addition of a custom error message provides clarity on the nature of the issue, making it easier for users or other developers to understand what went wrong and how to correct it. This practice significantly enhances code reliability and maintainability by preventing the propagation of erroneous values and states through the system."
